# Boosting

We have done Boosting for Regression and Classification using the UCI Dataset. 

Three boosting algorithms for Linear Regression. Each of the weak learners are trained on Concrete Dataset by randomly selecting 2 features among 8 (Total number of features).

Gradient Boosting
Frank-Wolfe Boosting
AdaBoost Regressor


Here, we test the performance of different boosting algorithms for Classification on the UCI breast cancer dataset. The three algorithms compared here are:

Adaboost
Logitboost
Frank-Wolfe boost

The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Website.
